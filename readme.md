## Synopsis

This is a project developed for MODE that required taking a PSD and converting it into a responsive web experience. The project needed a fluid grid system as well as a light-box, an animated navbar, form validation and an AJAX post to a SQL database.

For the grid system I decided to use Bootstrap due to it's fluidity and responsive breakpoints.

I created the light-box using a little jQuery and CSS3 animations.

Form validation was done using JavaScript and the post to the database was done using PHP and jQuery.ajax.

## Time Spent

Developing the front end(HTML, CSS and JS) of this project took about 4-5 hours to complete.
About 1 hour to set up the layout and prototype, 1.5 hours for styling and configuring spacing and typography. and about 1.5-2 hours handling scripts and creating the light-box.

Due to my lack of exposure to backend technologies, I spent several hours attempting to gain the knowledge to set up and configure databases as well as access them with PHP.

## Issues

While the front-end was pretty straight forward, I was lost when trying to handle any of the back-end of this project.  I am currently about to begin an online course for this, and would hope to be able to look back at this project and create the proper code required.
